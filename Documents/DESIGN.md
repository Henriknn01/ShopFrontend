# Design Guideline

## Theme:
-The theme of the website should be mostly serious with occasional playful elements

## Color Scheme
-The company which tasked us with creating the website did not have a color scheme <br />
-The main color is yet to be decided, but it is likely to be some shade of green <br />
-The accent colors will be white or blue with the intention of creating a modern looking website <br />

## Hierarchy and Layout
-The message that the company is trying to convey is clean aesthetic and the affordable prices of the products <br />
-The order of importance of different elements should be as follows: The hero element - menu bar - products <br />
-The various sections of the website are subject to change but as of right now are: Front page - Abouts Us - Checkout page - Order History - Product Page - Services <br />
-The layout that will be used on this page is: Grid Layout <br />

## Images
-The images are to be generated using AI and are subject to change <br />
-The text will be primarily aside images except the main banner on the front page. <br />
-Color-overlay on the images that do contain text <br />
-No blur on images <br />

## Icons
-We will use icons for the menu bar <br />
-Black and White icons <br />

## Border Rounding
-Borders should be fairly rounded to give off a slick aesthetic
